        <h2><a class="text-link">Our story</a></h2>
        <p>Morgan The Agency is the longest established International Model Agency in Ireland.Morgan started life as Nan Morgan Models in 1973, the brainchild of industry guru Nan Morgan.
            In the early 80's Nan recruited her daughter Rebecca, taking her away from the advertising industry. Over the years, in its quest for perfection, the agency expanded from Nan Morgan to Morgan Brand and finally to Morgan The Agency, increasing our portfolio of models and business substantially.
            Morgan The Agency went from strength to strength in all areas, including the International arena where we forged strong relationships with agencies across the globe becoming the first port of call for clients coming to Ireland to work and source new talent. We now have a wide representation of talent dotted around the globe.</p>
